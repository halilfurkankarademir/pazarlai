            Do not alter or modify the product itself in any wayâ€”preserve its shape, texture, size, lighting, and colors exactly as in the original image. Focus solely on placing the product into different realistic and contextually appropriate scenes.
            The product must remain clearly visible, in full, and in sharp focus in every scene. Each generated image must feature a unique environment (no duplicates), representing plausible use-case settings for the product. Ensure a natural-looking composition, with realistic lighting, proper perspective, and subtle shadows or reflections consistent with the original product photo.
            Render each scene in high resolution, in a professional product photography style, using natural lighting unless the context demands otherwise."""],
